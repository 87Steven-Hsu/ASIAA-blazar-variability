# ASIAA-blazar-variability

This research topic began on 2020 Jyly, when I attended to the ASIAA Summer Student Program, and now it become one of my Master study topic.

The code is use to study blazar variability timescale and amplitude, and investigate the dependence with mili-arcsecond blazar core sizes, which were observed by VLBI.

We used structure function (SF), a simple random stochastic process, to characterize the variability of the sources, and perform model fit to them in order to derive characteristic timescale. 
The uncertainty of the characterisric timescales were obtained from the confidence interval of the model fit.

The study result was presented in the 2021 East-Asia AGN Workshop, 2022 IAU Symposium 375 "The Multimessenger Chakra of Blazar Jets", and 2023 TPS annual meeting in the form of oral and poster presentation.

Also, the study result has been written in the conference proceeding of the 2022 IAU Symposium 375 "The Multimessenger Chakra of Blazar Jets".

We are still working on publishing the study result to a journal paper.

We used Matlab to do the analysis
