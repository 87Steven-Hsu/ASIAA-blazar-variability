# ASIAA-blazar-variability
The code to study blazar variability timescale and amplitude, and try to find their dependence with blazar mili-arcsecond core sizes, which were observed by VLBI

We used structure function (SF), a simple random stochastic process, to characterize the variability of the sources, and perform model fit to them in order to derive characteristic timescale. 
The uncertainty of the characterisric timescales were obtained from the confidence interval of the model fit.

We used Matlab to do the analysis
